Families in Households Typology (FHT) is a tool for classifying households in survey data based on family relations between their members. The typology was created within the EU and UKRI funded project "Risks, Resources and Inequalities: Increasing Resilience in European Families (rEUsilience)"

The codes (in Stata) are currently available for the following datasets:
* European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS)
* European Social Survey (ESS)
* European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)
* Household Budget Survey (HBS)

FHT contains 12 categories (see below) that can be freely aggregated or adjusted. 

1 Single adult household

2 Couples 

3 Single parents with dependent child 

4 Single parents with adult child 

5 Couples with dependent children
